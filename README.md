## Professor Chaja’s Comp 467 Summary

I want everyone to focus on what career path they want to start or continue once their tenure at CSUN is over with, but the central theme around this class is media and post production. During lectures, I will add experiences do/don’ts from my time at Dolby, Sony, Disney, Warner Bros, Myspace, etc. The class is pretty much like a Twitch streamer vibe, where all cameras are off and I focus just on chat. Poggers.

By end of the semester should get a decent start grip in the multimedia industry, also having done your resume, job interview experience, and can start tackling the job world.
